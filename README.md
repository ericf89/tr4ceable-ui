# tr4ceable-ui

:construction: :construction: :construction: :construction: :construction: :construction:

Easy now. This 'create-react-app'  was thrown together in just a few hours.  It's hacky, and there's lots of copy paste, and poor orginazation. It's purely for demonstration purposes of the tr4ceable api. 

The [import component](src/import.js) is kinda interesting though, so maybe check it out. Otherwise, beware!
